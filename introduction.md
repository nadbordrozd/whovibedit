# The Gallery Murder

The call came in at 11:15 PM. 

"We've got a body at the Meridian Gallery," dispatch said. "Looks like poison. And get this - the place has been locked down tight since eight. Everyone's still inside."

Now you're here, badge in hand, staring at five faces trying not to look guilty. Marcus Webb, gallery owner and tonight's corpse, is cooling in his office. Poisoned wine at an art opening. Classy way to go, if you have to go.

The security system sealed everyone in at 8 PM sharp. No way out until the screaming started at 8:45. That means your killer is one of these five art lovers, each with their own story, their own secrets, their own reasons to want Marcus Webb dead.

You've seen enough crime scenes to know the drill. Everyone lies about something. The innocent lie to hide their embarrassments. The guilty lie to hide their crimes. Your job? Figure out which is which.

Light up a mental cigarette, Detective. It's going to be a long night.

**The suspects are waiting. Time to get some answers.**
